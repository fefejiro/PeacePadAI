# PeacePad Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Reference-Based (Calm Communication)

**Primary References:** Linear (clean interface architecture) + Headspace (calming aesthetics) + Notion (organized information hierarchy)

**Core Principle:** Create a sanctuary for difficult conversations—every visual element should reduce tension, not amplify it.
