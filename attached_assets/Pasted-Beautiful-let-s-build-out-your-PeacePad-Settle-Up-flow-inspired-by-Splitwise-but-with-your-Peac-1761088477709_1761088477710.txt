Beautiful — let’s build out your PeacePad “Settle Up” flow inspired by Splitwise, but with your PeacePad UX philosophy (cooperative, not transactional).
Below is a complete design, logic, and database integration outline to hand to Replit for implementation.

🧾 PeacePad “Settle Up” Flow (Expense Settlement)

🌟 Purpose

The “Settle Up” feature allows two parents (Parent A & Parent B) to acknowledge and confirm shared expenses such as school supplies, childcare, or extracurricular costs.
It ensures transparency without direct banking integration — using a hybrid manual + external payment link confirmation approach.

⸻

🧩 1. Flow Overview

Step 1 — Expense Added
	•	Parent A creates an expense:
	•	Description: “Soccer uniform”
	•	Total: $120
	•	Split: 60% (Parent A) / 40% (Parent B)

Step 2 — Expense Auto-balancing
	•	The backend creates ExpenseParticipants entries with:
	•	owedAmount
	•	paidAmount
	•	percentage
	•	status = 'pending'

Step 3 — Initiate Settlement
	•	Parent A clicks “Settle Up” → options:
	1.	Mark as Paid (Manual)
	•	Updates status to initiated
	2.	Send Payment Link (External)
	•	Opens external options (e.g., Interac e-Transfer, PayPal, or Wise)
	•	PeacePad app deep-links to the preferred payment method

Step 4 — Confirmation Workflow

Actor	Action	System Update
Parent A	Marks as paid or shares payment link	status → pending confirmation
Parent B	Confirms receipt	status → confirmed
Either Parent	Disputes (if incorrect)	status → rejected

🧠 2. Backend Model Update

In your Prisma schema (or Supabase SQL):

model Settlement {
  id             String   @id @default(uuid())
  expenseId      String
  payerId        String
  receiverId     String
  amount         Float
  method         String   // 'manual', 'etransfer', 'paypal', 'wise'
  status         String   // 'initiated', 'pending_confirmation', 'confirmed', 'rejected'
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt
}


⸻

⚙️ 3. Logic Flow (Simplified Pseudocode)

// Initiate Settlement
POST /api/settle
{
  expenseId,
  payerId,
  receiverId,
  amount,
  method
}

// Backend Action
if (method === 'manual') {
  status = 'pending_confirmation';
} else {
  generatePaymentLink(method);
  status = 'initiated';
}

// Confirm Settlement
PATCH /api/settle/:id
{
  status: 'confirmed'
}

// Dispute Settlement
PATCH /api/settle/:id
{
  status: 'rejected',
  reason
}

💬 4. Frontend UI Behavior

Expense Page
	•	Each expense shows:
	•	💰 Total, Split Ratio
	•	🔁 Settle Up Button
	•	🕒 Status Badge: Pending / Confirmed / Rejected

Modal Dialog
	•	“How would you like to settle this expense?”
	•	🟢 Mark as Paid
	•	💳 Send via PayPal / Interac / Wise

After Action
	•	Show “Awaiting Confirmation” to payer
	•	Show “Confirm / Dispute” to receiver

⸻

🔔 5. Notifications (In-App + Email)
	1.	Parent B receives:
“Parent A has marked ‘Soccer uniform’ as paid. Please confirm.”
	2.	Parent A receives:
“Your payment for ‘Soccer uniform’ has been confirmed.”

⸻

📊 6. Reporting and Balance Logic
	•	partnership_balances table recalculates automatically on confirmation:

UPDATE partnership_balances
SET net_balance = net_balance - {amount}
WHERE partnership_id = {id};


	•	Optional: Create a view to summarize by parent:

CREATE VIEW balance_summary AS
SELECT partnership_id, user_id, SUM(owedAmount - paidAmount) AS net_balance
FROM expenses
GROUP BY partnership_id, user_id;



⸻

🔒 7. Privacy & Security
	•	No bank logins or credentials stored.
	•	All external payments happen off-platform.
	•	PeacePad only records what’s confirmed by both users.

⸻

🚀 8. Future Expansion
	•	Add Plaid API (optional) for verified payment detection.
	•	Add auto reminders for unconfirmed settlements after X days.
	•	Gamify fairness — “Your co-parent consistency score” (like a credit meter).

Would you like me to now package this as a PeacePad_SettleUp_Iteration.zip (containing:
📄 dev instruction doc,
📜 backend model schema,
🖥️ frontend flow pseudocode, and
🎨 wireframe reference)?
You could drop it straight into Replit for iteration tracking.
